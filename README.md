# dsa

dsa is my C implementation of basic data structures and algorithms.

Based on books I used to prepare for the Graduation Entrance Exam, and Internet, of course.

Currently includes tree and graph.

There are several interesting sites inspired this project :
- [Amazing visulisation of data structures and algorithms](https://visualgo.net/)
- [MIT course-Introduction to Algorithms: 6.006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm)
- [My github repository of MIT course-Introduction to Algorithms](https://github.com/hyqLeonardo/algorithm.git)
